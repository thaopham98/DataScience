# Police Incident Reports - Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This Power BI report visualizes **police incident reports** to analyze crime trends, district-wise incidents, and temporal crime patterns. The goal is to provide actionable insights for law enforcement, policymakers, and the public.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this report contains police incident records, including:
- **Incident Date**: The date when the incident occurred.
- **Police District**: The district where the incident was reported.
- **Incident Type**: The category of the reported crime.
- **Resolution**: The outcome of the incident (e.g., Arrest, Unresolved, etc.).

## 📊 Features
The dashboard includes **6 interactive charts** for in-depth analysis:

1. **Number of Incidents by Day of Week** 📅  
   - Visualizes the distribution of incidents across days of the week to identify peak crime days.

2. **Incidents by Police District** 📍  
   - Displays the number of incidents reported in each police district using a **bar chart** or **map visualization**.

3. **Top 5 Incident Categories** 🔍  
   - Highlights the most frequent types of incidents reported, providing a breakdown of the top 5 crime categories.

4. **Number of Incidents by Year** 📈  
   - Tracks the trend of incidents over the years to identify increasing or decreasing crime rates.

5. **Incident Resolution** ✅  
   - Shows the outcomes of reported incidents (e.g., Arrest, Unresolved, etc.) to analyze resolution rates.

6. **Report Filing Insights** ⏳  
   - Analyzes the time taken to file reports or other temporal patterns related to incident reporting.
