# Police Incident Reports - Power BI Dashboard

## üìå Overview
This Power BI report visualizes **police incident reports** to analyze crime trends, district-wise incidents, and temporal crime patterns. The goal is to provide actionable insights for law enforcement, policymakers, and the public.

## üìÇ Dataset
The dataset used in this report contains police incident records, including:
- **Incident Date**: The date when the incident occurred.
- **Police District**: The district where the incident was reported.
- **Incident Type**: The category of the reported crime.
- **Resolution**: The outcome of the incident (e.g., Arrest, Unresolved, etc.).

## üîÑ Data Cleaning and ELT Process
Before importing the data into Power BI, an ETL/ELT process was performed to ensure accuracy and consistency:

1. Uploading to Google Cloud:
   - The raw dataset was uploaded to Google Cloud for secure storage and centralized access.
   - Leveraged Google BigQuery as the ELT platform, allowing for scalable data transformation directly within the cloud.

2. Data Cleaning in SQL:
   - Utilized SQL in Google BigQuery to perform data cleaning operations:
      - Extraction & Loading: The dataset was extracted from its source and loaded into BigQuery.
      - Transformation: Removed duplicates and null values, standardized date formats for Incident Date, and extracted time-based features (Year, Quarter, Month).
   - Categorization: Categorized incidents (e.g., into Violent and Non-Violent) and normalized categorical data where necessary.
      - This ELT approach allowed heavy transformations to be executed in the cloud environment before data was consumed by Power BI.

3. Importing into Power BI:
   - Connected Power BI to the cleaned dataset in BigQuery.
   - Established necessary relationships between tables and applied additional DAX measures for further analysis.

## üìä Features
The dashboard includes **multiple interactive charts** across three pages, providing a comprehensive analysis of police incident reports. Below is a breakdown of the visualizations and their purpose:

---

### **Page 1: Overview**

1. **Number of Incidents by Day of Week** üìÖ  
   - A bar chart showing the distribution of incidents across days of the week to identify peak crime days.

2. **Incidents by Police District** üìç  
   - A map bubble visualization displaying the number of incidents reported in each police district.

3. **Top 5 Incident Categories** üîç  
   - A bar chart highlighting the most frequent types of incidents reported, with **Larceny Theft** as the most common category.

4. **Number of Incidents by Year** üìà  
   - A bar chart tracking the trend of incidents over the years to identify increasing or decreasing crime rates.

5. **Incident Resolution** ‚úÖ  
   - A funnel chart showing the outcomes of reported incidents (e.g., Arrest, Unresolved, etc.) to analyze resolution rates.

6. **Report Online Filing Insights** üñ•Ô∏è  
   - A donut chart displaying the proportion of incidents filed online versus offline.

---

### **Page 2: Incident Details**

![Incident Details](https://github.com/thaopham98/DataScience/blob/main/images/Police%20Incident%20Reports%20-%20Incident%20Details.png)

1. **Count of Incident Number** üî¢  
   - A card visualization showing the total number of incidents.

2. **Incidents by Police District** üìä  
   - A treemap visualization providing an alternative view of incident distribution by police district.

3. **Violent vs. Non-violent Incidents** ‚öñÔ∏è  
   - A bar chart comparing the number of violent, non-violent, and other incident types.

4. **Incidents by Year, Quarter, and Month** üìÖ  
   - A line chart showing trends in incidents over time, broken down by year, quarter, and month.

5. **Subcategories of Larceny Theft** ü•ß  
   - A pie chart displaying the subcategories of **Larceny Theft**, the most frequent incident type.

---

### **Page 3: Advanced Analysis**

![Advanced Analysis](https://github.com/thaopham98/DataScience/blob/main/images/Police%20Incident%20Reports%20-%20Advanced%20Analysis.png)

1. **Filters** üîç  
   - A dropdown slicer for filtering data by **Year** and **Police District**.

2. **Correlation Between Incident Type, Resolution, and File Online** üîó  
   - A heatmap visualizing the relationship between incident types, resolutions, and whether the incident was filed online.

## DAX Measures & Calculated Columns
Below are the key DAX formulas applied in this project:

### Year-Quarter Formatting
```DAX
YearQuarter = FORMAT([Incident Date], "YYYY") & "-Q" & FORMAT([Incident Date], "Q")
```
*This column formats the incident date into a Year-Quarter format (e.g., 2024-Q1).*  

### Full Police District Name
```DAX
Full_District = [Police District] & ", San Francisco, CA"
```
*This calculated column appends the city name to the police district for a complete location reference.*  

### Incident Type Classification
```DAX
Incident_Type = 
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    [Incident Category] IN { "Assault", "Homicide", "Rape", "Robbery", 
                                    "Weapons Offense", "Weapons Carrying Etc", 
                                    "Sex Offense", "Human Trafficking (A), Commercial Sex Acts", 
                                    "Offences Against The Family And Children" }, "Violent",
    
    [Incident Category] IN { "Larceny Theft", "Burglary", "Fraud", "Forgery And Counterfeiting", 
                                    "Embezzlement", "Stolen Property", "Motor Vehicle Theft", "Motor Vehicle Theft?", 
                                    "Recovered Vehicle", "Traffic Violation Arrest", "Traffic Collision", 
                                    "Vandalism", "Malicious Mischief", "Drug Offense", "Drug Violation", 
                                    "Arson", "Liquor Laws", "Prostitution", "Suspicious Occ" }, "Non-Violent",
    
    "Other"
)
```
*This measure categorizes incidents into 'Violent,' 'Non-Violent,' or 'Other' based on the type of crime.*  

### Filed Online Percentage
```DAX
Filed Online Percentage = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNT('Subset of Police_Department_Inc'[Incident ID]), 'Subset of Police_Department_Inc'[Filed Online] = TRUE()),
    COUNT('Subset of Police_Department_Inc'[Incident ID]),
    0
)
```

### **Key Insights**
- The dashboard provides a clear overview of crime trends, incident types, and resolution rates.
- Users can drill down into specific details, such as subcategories of **Larceny Theft** or temporal patterns in incidents.
- Advanced visualizations like the heatmap and stacked area chart enable deeper analysis of correlations and trends.

---

### **Future Enhancements**
- Add a **slicer for Incident Category** to allow users to filter the pie chart and other visualizations by incident type.
- Include **dynamic titles** for visualizations to reflect user selections (e.g., "Subcategories for [Selected Incident Category]").
- Enhance interactivity with **bookmarks** to save default views (e.g., Larceny Theft as the default category).
