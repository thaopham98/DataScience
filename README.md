# DataScience Project

This repository contains data and Python analysis for various projects. It's organized into two main folders: `data` for storing datasets and `python_analysis` for Jupyter Notebooks containing the analysis code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **Python:** Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
*   **Jupyter Notebook:** Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

*   **Required Python Libraries:** Install the necessary libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn  # Add other libraries as needed
    ```

    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv        # Create a virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate on macOS/Linux
    .venv\Scripts\activate      # Activate on Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Install from requirements.txt (see below)
    ```

    Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the root of your repository listing all your dependencies like this:

    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    jupyter
    # ... any other libraries
    ```

### Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/thaopham98/DataScience.git](https://github.com/thaopham98/DataScience.git)
    cd DataScience
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:** (See above)

3.  **Navigate to the `python_analysis` folder:**

    ```bash
    cd python_analysis
    ```

4.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    This will open Jupyter Notebook in your web browser.

## Usage Examples

The `python_analysis` folder contains Jupyter Notebooks with examples of data analysis using the datasets provided in the `data` folder. Each notebook focuses on a specific analysis or project.

*   **Data Folder (`data`):** This folder contains the datasets used in the analysis. The datasets are typically in CSV, TSV, or other common data formats. *Describe the type of data stored here (e.g., "Customer data," "Sales data," etc.)*
*   **Python Analysis Folder (`python_analysis`):** This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate how to:
    *   Load and preprocess the data.
    *   Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    *   Apply machine learning models (if applicable).
    *   Visualize the results.

*Provide a brief example for each notebook in the `python_analysis` folder. For example:*

*   `analysis_notebook_1.ipynb`: This notebook performs customer segmentation using k-means clustering.

## Data

The `data` folder contains the datasets used for analysis. *Provide more details about the data, such as its source, format, and any preprocessing steps performed.*
